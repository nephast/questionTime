# Welcome to question time!

To run this game you will need `mongodb` installed in your computer 
[Find more about mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

## Run npm start 
Add user / question using admin routes (user/question) if necessary 

## Run npm test
The same DB is used for the tests. It will be cleaned at start of tests but will keep data afterward so it can be inspected if needed.

Enjoy! :)
